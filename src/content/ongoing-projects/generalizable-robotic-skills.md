Robotic manipulation faces significant challenges due to the complexity of learning generalizable skills that can transfer across tasks, robotic platforms, and real-world scenarios. This project proposes to address this challenge by exploring latent space representations learned from large-scale robotic datasets to develop transferable assistive robotic skills. The objective of this project is to learn a structured latent space that captures essential features of robotic manipulation trajectories and can be leveraged to train skill-conditioned policies for assistive tasks. By employing advanced machine learning techniques such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Vector Quantized VAEs (VQ-VAEs), and Transformer-based models, this research aims to create a robust and compact latent representation that enables skill generalization across different robotic platforms and manipulation tasks. This research will contribute to the development of a scalable and transferable skill-learning framework that can be used in assistive robotics, enabling robots to perform everyday tasks more efficiently. The findings from this project will serve as a foundation for future research on leveraging learned representations for policy learning, hierarchical skill composition, and real-world deployment of assistive robotic systems.
