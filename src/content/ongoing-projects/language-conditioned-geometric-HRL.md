The candidate will do research in Variable Impedance Control (VIC) conditioned on language instructions, vision and user preferences within the project DROVIC (Data-driven Robot Variable Impedance Control with Context Awareness).

DROVIC aims to bridge the disparity between high-level instructions in large AI models for robotics, and low-level robot execution. This will be tackled by building a common features framework for variable impedance controllers to understand different kinds of inputs, such as language, proprioceptive information (vision, forces, etc.) and user preferences. This will allow for a context aware definition of such controllers and their reference, taking user preferences into account naturally. The theoretical results will be implemented with Franka robots in assistive robotics scenarios and/or manipulation of non-rigid or fragile objects.
