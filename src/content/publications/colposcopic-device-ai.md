The following article presents the development of a
low-cost digital colposcopy device designed to fit a wide range
of speculum sizes, offering 99% diagnostic accuracy. The main
objective is to provide an affordable alternative to conventional
colposcopy systems, which typically range in price from US
$9,000 to US $12,000. Traditional colposcopy has been shown by
studies to be limited in its diagnostic accuracy. This technique,
based on visual interpretation by an experienced gynecologist,
only achieves 80% accuracy compared to histological results.
In response to this difficulty, the developed device merges two
technologies: the analysis by spectrography, adding RGB LEDs
that will modify the contrast of the acetowhitening effect of the
cervix, and the incorporation of a transformers based artificial
intelligence algorithm, designed for multi-class images classifica-
tion. In conclusion, the proposed low-cost portable colposcope
offers a significant advance in cervical pathology detection,
providing high diagnostic accuracy comparable to conventional
systems at a fraction of the cost. This innovation has the potential
to greatly impact marginalized communities or resource-limited
regions without access to affordable diagnostic tools or the
presence of highly skilled personnel.
