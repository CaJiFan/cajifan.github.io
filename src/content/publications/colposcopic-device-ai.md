The following article presents the development of a low-cost digital colposcopy device designed to fit a wide range of speculum sizes, offering 99% diagnostic accuracy. The main objective is to provide an affordable alternative to conventional colposcopy systems, which typically range in price from US $9,000 to US $12,000. Traditional colposcopy has been shown by studies to be limited in its diagnostic accuracy. This technique, based on visual interpretation by an experienced gynecologist, only achieves 80% accuracy compared to histological results. In response to this difficulty, the developed device merges two technologies: the analysis by spectrography, adding RGB LEDs that will modify the contrast of the acetowhitening effect of the cervix, and the incorporation of a transformers based artificial intelligence algorithm, designed for multi-class images classification. In conclusion, the proposed low-cost portable colposcope offers a significant advance in cervical pathology detection, providing high diagnostic accuracy comparable to conventional systems at a fraction of the cost. This innovation has the potential to greatly impact marginalized communities or resource-limited regions without access to affordable diagnostic tools or the presence of highly skilled personnel.
