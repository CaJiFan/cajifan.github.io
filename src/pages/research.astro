          My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics, embodied AI, and the pursuit of <b>Artificial General
          Intelligence (AGI)</b>. I am fascinated by the idea of enabling robots to <b>generalize not only in the skills they acquire, but
          also in the task representations they encode</b>, effectively allowing them to <it>reason, adapt, and act</it> more efficiently to
          unseen environments.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>  
          My current focus is on integrating <b>Causal Representation Learning</b> with <b>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</b>
          to improve the sample efficiency, generalizability, and explainability of robotic decision-making.

          By grounding RL in structured latent spaces and causal abstractions, I aim to create agents that can extract reusable knowledge from
          data and transfer it across different tasks and domains, moving closer to generalist robotic intelligence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Beyond these directions, I am particularly interested in advancing <b>Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL)</b>. 
          While much research emphasizes <i>catastrophic forgetting</i>, I believe the future lies in underexplored problems such as </b>forward 
          transfer</b>, where past skills accelerate learning of new ones, and <b>task-agnostic continual RL</b>, 
          where agents learn continuously without explicit knowledge of task boundaries.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of <b>generalist robots</b> capable of robust,
          adaptive and lifelong learning behavior across diverse real-world tasks.
