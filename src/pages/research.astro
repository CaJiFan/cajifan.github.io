          My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics, embodied AI, and the pursuit of <b>Artificial General
          Intelligence (AGI)</b>. I am fascinated by the idea of enabling robots to <b>generalize not only in the skills they acquire, but
          also in the task representations they encode</b>, effectively allowing them to <it>reason, adapt, and act</it> more efficiently to
          unseen environments.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>  
          My current focus is on advancing <b>Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL)</b>. 
          While much research emphasizes <i>catastrophic forgetting</i>, I believe the future lies in underexplored problems such as <i><b>forward 
          transfer</b></i>, where past skills accelerate learning of new ones, and <i><b>task-agnostic continual RL</b></i>, 
          where agents learn continuously without explicit knowledge of task boundaries.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Beyond these directions, I am particularly interested in integrating <b>Causal Representation Learning</b> with <b>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</b>
          to improve the sample efficiency, generalizability, and explainability of robotic decision-making.

          By grounding RL in structured latent spaces and causal abstractions, I aim to create agents that can extract reusable knowledge from
          data and transfer it across different tasks and domains, moving closer to generalist robotic intelligence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of <b>generalist robots</b> capable of robust,
          adaptive and lifelong learning behavior across diverse real-world tasks.

      My research interests lie at the intersection of <b>Machine Learning</b>, <b>Robotics</b>, and the pursuit of 
      <b>Embodied Artificial General Intelligence (E-AGI)</b>. 
      I am primarily focused on <b>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</b> theory and its application to robot learning systems
      that can reason, adapt, and act robustly in the real world.

    <div class="text-3xl py-3 font-bold">Reinforcement Learning and Continual Adaptation</div>

    <p>
      My current research direction focuses on improving <b>generalization</b>, <b>sample efficiency</b>, and <b>lifelong adaptability</b> 
      in <b>Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL)</b>. 
      I am particularly interested in developing agents that can learn continuously from experience 
      without catastrophic forgetting or the need for task-specific supervision.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 py-2 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <b>Task-Agnostic Continual RL:</b> Most continual RL research focuses on mitigating catastrophic forgetting. 
        My interest lies in advancing <b>forward transfer</b> — enabling past knowledge to accelerate future learning — and 
        <b>task-agnostic continual learning</b>, where agents adapt seamlessly without explicit task boundaries.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Causal Reasoning in RL:</b> I am exploring how <b>causal representation learning</b> can structure the latent spaces of RL agents, 
        improving <b>generalization</b>, <b>explainability</b>, and <b>data efficiency</b>. 
        This involves learning disentangled, causally grounded state representations that allow for 
        transfer across tasks and environments — moving closer to generalist robotic intelligence.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Equivariance and Symmetry in RL:</b> I am interested in how <b>equivariant neural architectures</b> 
        can encode the underlying symmetries of physical environments (e.g., SE(3) transformations in manipulation). 
        Such inductive biases can dramatically improve generalization across viewpoints and configurations, 
        and are especially promising when combined with continual or causal RL frameworks.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="text-3xl py-3 font-bold">Robot Learning and Multimodal Perception</div>

    <p>
      My work also investigates how RL agents can benefit from <b>rich multimodal perception</b>. 
      In particular, I believe the future of robotics lies in <b>tactile sensing</b> — the ability to 
      perceive and react to physical contact with the environment. 
      Integrating tactile and proprioceptive feedback with vision and language will enable more 
      robust, context-aware, and compliant robot behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within this scope, I am drawn to <b>Variable Impedance Control (VIC)</b> as a mechanism for safe and adaptive interaction. 
      Combining VIC with learning-based policies can bridge the gap between high-level reasoning and low-level compliant control, 
      allowing robots to handle dynamic, contact-rich manipulation tasks with precision and safety.
